# DL-Sports_Images_Detection
  
The goal of this project is to build a Neural Network for Image Classification. Having learned a few things about Computer Vision in class recently, I would like to try to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify some images. The dataset that I will be using comes form Kaggle.  

The strategy for this task is following : first, we need to load the data and create two sets, a training set and a test set ; then, we need to build the CNN : in order to do that, we will use a model that I built in class for a similar task (MNIST Digit Classification) and we will adapt it to our needs. Finally, we will test our tuned model and compute the accuracy.
